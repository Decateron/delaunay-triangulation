#delaunay-triangulation [![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/Decateron/delaunay-triangulation.svg?token=ZMKSt61qYsroKf5FBCgc&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/Decateron/delaunay-triangulation)

An application built for real-time rendering and analysis of Delaunay triangulations made with JavaFX 8. 

The goal of this program is to provide tools to aid in the research of certain properties of Delaunay triangulations, though it could be easily be extended to support other geometrical graphs.

This program supports most edge cases not handled by many algorithms, though there currently isn't support for displaying multiple versions of non-unique Delaunay triangulations.
