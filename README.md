# delaunay-triangulation

An application for live rendering of Delaunay triangulations (though it should be able to support other 2D geometrical structures as well), built with JavaFX 8. The goal of this program is to provide tools to aid in the research of certain properties of Delaunay triangulations, though it is still early into development.
